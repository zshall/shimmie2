Zach's Shimmie stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This fork of Shish's Shimmie2 software is a sandbox in which I develop
extensions. If you want to download core Shimmie software, get it from Shish
[http://shimmie.shishnet.org/], as it will most definitely be more stable
and up to date.

Extensions in development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ User Preferences Class - Your own personal $config
+ Preferences Extension  - All the joys of /setup/, but per user

Almost all of the extensions below require the two above (which are in
development themselves)
+ Profile - Because there's more to you than a name
+ User Levels - 400 more exp to go till level 20!
+ Moderator system - Even admins need help sometimes
+ Theme Chooser - What CSS should I wear today?

Downloads from this fork
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Coming soon. Most extensions developed here will be able to be seen in action
on my production Shimmie install at [http://seemslegit.com] after Shimmie 2.3
is released.

Licence
~~~~~~~
All code is GPLv2 unless mentioned otherwise; ie, if you give shimmie to
someone else, you have to give them the source (which should be easy, as PHP
is an interpreted language...). If you want to add customisations to your own
site, then those customisations belong to you, and you can do what you want
with them.
